This file contains changes specific to the scripts repo. See docs/changelog.txt
in the dfhack repo for a full description, or
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/dev/Documentation.html#building-the-changelogs

NOTE: currently, gen_changelog.py expects a "Future" section to exist at the
top of this file (even if no changes are listed under it), or you will get a
"Entry without section" error. Also, to maintain proper sorting in the generated
changelogs when making a new release, docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo must
have the new release listed in the right place, even if no changes were made in
that repo.

# Future

## New Tools
- `undump-buildings`: (reinstated) remove dump designation from in-use building materials
- `gui/petitions`: (reinstated) show outstanding (or all historical) petition agreements for guildhalls and temples
- `gui/notify`: display important notifications that vanilla doesn't support yet and provide quick zoom links to notification targets. Initial supported notification types: trader finished unloading, agitated creatures on map, invaders on map, petitions for guildhalls/temples not yet satisfied, production mandate nearing expiration time

## New Features

## Fixes
- `gui/design`: fix clicking the center point when there is a mark behind it entering both mark dragging and center dragging at the same time. Now you can click once to move the shape, and click twice to move only the mark behind the center point.
- `source`: fix issue where removing sources would make some other sources inactive

## Misc Improvements
- `exportlegends`: make progress increase smoothly over the entire export and increase precision of progress percentage
- `gui/autobutcher`: ask for confirmation before zeroing out targets for all races

## Removed

# 50.11-r6

# 50.11-r5

## New Tools

- `gui/settings-manager`: save and load embark difficulty settings and standing orders; options for auto-load on new embark

## Fixes
- `source`: water and magma sources and sinks now persist with fort across saves and loads
- `gui/design`: fix incorrect dimensions being shown when you're placing a stockpile, but a start coordinate hasn't been selected yet

- `confirm`: properly detect clicks on the remove zone button even when the unit selection screen is also open (e.g. the vanilla assign animal to pasture panel)
- `caravan`: ensure items are marked for trade when the move trade goods dialog is closed even when they were selected and then the list filters were changed such that the items were no longer actively shown
- `quickfort`: if a blueprint specifies an up/down stair, but the tile the blueprint is applied to cannot make an up stair (e.g. it has already been dug out), still designate a down stair if possible
- `suspendmanager`: correctly handle building collisions with smoothing designations when the building is on the edge of the map
- `empty-bin`: now correctly sends ammunition in carried quivers to the tile underneath the unit instead of teleporting them to an invalid (or possibly just far away) location

- `gui/control-panel`: reduce frequency for `warn-stranded` check to once every 2 days
- `gui/control-panel`: tools are now organized by type: automation, bugfix, and gameplay

# 50.11-r4

## New Tools
- `build-now`: (reinstated) instantly complete unsuspended buildings that are ready to be built

## Fixes
- `combine`: prevent stack sizes from growing beyond quantities that you would normally see in vanilla gameplay
- `gui/design`: Center dragging shapes now track the mouse correctly

## Misc Improvements

# 50.11-r3

## New Tools
- `sync-windmills`: synchronize or randomize movement of active windmills
- `trackstop`: (reimplemented) integrated overlay for changing track stop and roller settings after construction

## New Features
- `gui/design`: show selected dimensions next to the mouse cursor when designating with vanilla tools, for example when painting a burrow or designating digging

## Misc Improvements
- `warn-stranded`: don't warn for units that are temporarily on unwalkable tiles (e.g. as they pass under a waterfall)

## Removed
- `gui/control-panel`: removed always-on system services from the ``System`` tab: `buildingplan`, `confirm`, `logistics`, and `overlay`. The base services should not be turned off by the player. Individual confirmation prompts can be managed via `gui/confirm`, and overlays (including those for `buildingplan` and `logistics`) are managed on the control panel ``Overlays`` tab.
- `gui/control-panel`: removed `autolabor` from the ``Fort`` and ``Autostart`` tabs. The tool does not function correctly with the new labor types, and is causing confusion. You can still enable `autolabor` from the commandline with ``enable autolabor`` if you understand and accept its limitations.

# 50.11-r2

## New Tools

## Fixes
- `suspendmanager`: fix errors when constructing near the map edge
- `gui/sandbox`: fix scrollbar moving double distance on click
- `hide-tutorials`: fix the embark tutorial prompt sometimes not being skipped
- `full-heal`: fix removal of corpse after resurrection
- `toggle-kbd-cursor`: clear the cursor position when disabling, preventing the game from sometimes jumping the viewport around when cursor keys are hit

## Misc Improvements
- `prioritize`: refuse to automatically prioritize dig and smooth/carve job types since it can break the DF job scheduler; instead, print a suggestion that the player use specialized units and vanilla designation priorities
- `gui/overlay`: filter overlays by current context so there are fewer on the screen at once and you can more easily click on the one you want to reposition
- `quickfort`: now allows constructions to be built on top of constructed floors and ramps, just like vanilla. however, to allow blueprints to be safely reapplied to the same area, for example to fill in buildings whose constructions were canceled due to lost items, floors will not be rebuilt on top of floors and ramps will not be rebuilt on top of ramps
- `gui/gm-editor`: for fields with primitive types, change from click to edit to click to select, double-click to edit. this should help prevent accidental modifications to the data and make hotkeys easier to use (since you have to click on a data item to use a hotkey on it)
