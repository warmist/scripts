.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Controls population and migration caps persistently per-fort.
    :tags: unavailable

This script controls `hermit` and the various population caps per-fortress.
It is intended to be run from ``dfhack-config/init/onMapLoad.init`` as
``pop-control on-load``.

If you edit the population caps using `gui/settings-manager` after
running this script, your population caps will be reset and you may
get more migrants than you expect.
