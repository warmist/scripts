    :summary: Fix units who refuse to awaken in adventure mode.
    :tags: unavailable

Use this tool if you encounter sleeping units who refuse to awaken regardless of
talking to them, hitting them, or waiting so long you die of thirst
(:bug:`6798`). If you come across one or more bugged sleepers in adventure
mode, simply run the script and all nearby sleepers will be cured.
