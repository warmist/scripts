    :summary: Thrash your enemies with a flying suplex.
    :tags: unavailable

Attack another unit and then run this command to grab them and fly in a glorious
parabolic arc to where you have placed the cursor. You'll land safely and your
opponent will slam into the ground, skidding away. Extra points for skidding
them into a wall or off a cliff! The farther you jump, the harder they slam.
Launch six tiles away or more for some serious pain!

Note that if you run this command *without* attacking an enemy first, it will be
*you* that slams into the ground. Launching yourself 3 tiles or so should be
fine (e.g. to surprise an approaching enemy), but don't expect to survive after
jumping across the map!
