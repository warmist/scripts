.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Manages seed and plant cooking based on seed stock levels.
    :tags: fort auto plants

This is the configuration interface for the `seedwatch` plugin. You can configure
a target stock amount for each seed type. If the number of seeds of that type falls
below the target, then the plants and seeds of that type will be protected from
cookery. If the number rises above the target + 20, then cooking will be allowed
again.
