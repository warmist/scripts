Overlay
-------

This script provides an overlay that shows the currently enabled notifications
(when applicable). If you click on an active notification in the list, it will
bring up a screen where you can do something about it or will zoom the map to
the target. If there are multiple targets, each successive click on the
notification (or press of the :kbd:`Enter` key) will zoom to the next target.
You can also shift click (or press :kbd:`Shift`:kbd:`Enter`) to zoom to the
previous target.
