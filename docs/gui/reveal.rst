This script provides a means for you to safely glimpse at unexplored areas of
the map, such as the caverns, so you can plan your fort with full knowledge of
the terrain. When you open `gui/reveal`, the map will be revealed. You can see
where the caverns are, and you can designate what you want for digging. When
you close `gui/reveal`, the map will automatically be unrevealed so you can
continue normal gameplay. If you want the reveal to be permanent, you can
toggle the setting before you close `gui/reveal`.

Usage
-----

::

    gui/reveal [hell]

Examples
--------

``gui/reveal``
    Reveal all "normal" terrain, but keep areas with late-game surprises hidden.
``gui/reveal hell``
    Fully reveal adamantine spires, gemstone pillars, and the underworld. Note
    that keeping these areas unrevealed when you exit `gui/reveal` will trigger
    all the surprise events immediately.
