.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: List mechanisms and links connected to a building.
    :tags: unavailable

This convenient tool lists the mechanisms connected to the building and the
buildings linked via the mechanisms. Navigating the list centers the view on the
relevant linked building.

To exit, press :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`Enter`; :kbd:`Esc` recenters on the original
building, while :kbd:`Enter` leaves focus on the current one.
:kbd:`Shift`:kbd:`Enter` has an effect equivalent to pressing :kbd:`Enter`, and
then re-entering the mechanisms UI.
