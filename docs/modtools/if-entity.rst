==================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Run DFHack commands based on current civ id.
    :tags: unavailable dev

Run a command if the current entity matches a given ID.

To use this script effectively it needs to be called from "raw/onload.init".
Calling this from the main dfhack.init file will do nothing, as no world has
been loaded yet.

Usage
-----

``id``
    Specify the entity ID to match
``cmd [ commandStrs ]``
    Specify the command to be run if the current entity matches the entity
    given via -id

All arguments are required.

Example
-------

``if-entity -id "FOREST" -cmd [ lua "print('Dirty hippies.')" ]``
    Print a message if you load an elf fort, but not a dwarf, human, etc. fort.
