=============

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Exports extended legends data for external viewing.
    :tags: legends inspection

When run from the legends mode screen, this tool will export detailed data
about your world so that it can be browsed with external programs like
:forums:`Legends Browser <179848>`. The data is more detailed than what you can
get with vanilla export functionality, and many external tools depend on this
extra information.

By default, ``exportlegends`` hooks into the standard vanilla ``Export XML`` button and runs in the background when you click it, allowing both the vanilla export and the extended data export to execute simultaneously. You can continue to browse legends mode via the vanilla UI while the export is running.

To use:

- Enter legends by "Starting a new game" in an existing world and selecting
  Legends mode
- Ensure the toggle for "Also export extended legends data" is on (which is the
  default)
- Click the "Export XML" button to generate both the standard export and the
  extended data export

You can also generate just the extended data export by manually running the
``exportlegends`` command while legends mode is open.

Usage
-----

::

    exportlegends

Overlay
-------

This script also provides an overlay that is managed by the `overlay` framework.
When the overlay is enabled, a toggle for exporting extended legends data will
appear below the vanilla "Export XML" button. If the toggle is enabled when the
"Export XML" button is clicked, then ``exportlegends`` will run alongside the
vanilla data export.

While the extended data is being exported, a status line will appear in place
of the toggle, reporting the current export target and the overall percent
complete.

There is an additional overlay that masks out the "Done" button while the
extended export is running. This prevents the player from exiting legends mode
before the export is complete.
