    :summary: Adventure as any living historical figure.
    :tags: unavailable

This tool allows you to play as any living (or undead) historical figure (except
for deities) in adventure mode.

To use, simply run the command at the start of adventure mode character
creation. You will be presented with a searchable list from which you may choose
your desired historical figure.

This figure will be added to the "Specific Person" list at the bottom of the
creature selection page. They can then be picked for use as a player character,
the same as when regaining control of a retired adventurer.
